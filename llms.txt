# Claude Code Optimization for All Providers - LLM Index

Summary:
Public, sanitized operational handbook for running Kimi/Claude/MiniMax provider switching with Claude Code in MCP-heavy workflows.

Primary docs:
- README.md
- docs/README.md
- docs/LESSONS.md
- docs/ACTIONS_LOG.md
- docs/BACKUPS.md
- docs/SWARM_OPTIMIZATION.md
- docs/PROFILE_SWITCHING.md
- docs/INSTALLATION.md
- AGENTS.md
- RELEASE_NOTES.md
- agent-manifest.json

Key facts:
- Target runtime model: kimi-for-coding
- Known compatibility issue: ToolSearch -> tool_reference can trigger HTTP 400
- Verified mitigation: disable ToolSearch for this workflow
- One-command profile switch: cc-provider (kimi/claude/minimax/status)
- Switch is idempotent and prints previous -> current provider/API summary
- One-command install available via install-from-github.sh (curl/wget)
- README now includes logo-based visual onboarding (Claude/Kimi/MiniMax/Ollama)
- Autonomous orchestration rule enables commandless multi-agent spawn on complex tasks
- SOR upload scope guard: do not use File case path unless explicitly requested

Intended use:
- Troubleshooting reference
- Operational playbook
- Agent-readable context for AI tooling
